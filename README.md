### **Medallion Architecture Data Warehouse - Business Insights & KPI Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a **Medallion Architecture-based Data Warehouse** designed for **Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics**. It follows a structured data modeling approach using **Fact-Dimension Schema** and **Single Big Table (SBT)** to enable efficient query execution and insightful KPI analysis.  

The system integrates **sales, customer, product, and location data** to provide a comprehensive view of business performance. The goal is to optimize **data processing, query performance, and analytics readiness** for reporting and visualization in **Power BI, Tableau, or other BI tools**.
